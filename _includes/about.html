                    <p>I'm the center of the Venn diagram of engineers, programmers, and mechanics. Specifically, I enjoy the math and programming behind the things that I build. Whether I'm analyzing the parts and flight path of my trebuchet or experimenting with silly projectile effects in a game, I find a way to incorporate many of my interests into each project.</p>

                    <p>I'm currently in a middle school romance with machine learning. It's awkward and neither of us really knows what it means or how to commit. Eventually I will build that AI-controlled foam plane though. </p>
