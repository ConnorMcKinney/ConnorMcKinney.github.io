description: "

A 1kg glider that I designed and built during Space Hardware Club's '2 Month Challenge' in my freshman year. I prepared trade studies, preliminary design review presentations, and attended classes held
 by the club before beginning the build. The wings are 3D printed ribs with rip-stop nylon as a skin, the body is made out of foam board insulation, and the heart of the electronics
 is a Teensy 3.2 quasi-Arduino board. The Teensy read data from a 9 axis MPU, a barometer/thermistor, and saved data to a micro SD card. <br><br>
 
 My glider had a successful flight, activating a nichrome hotwire to detach from a weather balloon at an altitude of 300m. It descended at a rate of 4m/s and I was able to pull
 all the data into Matlab for analysis.
