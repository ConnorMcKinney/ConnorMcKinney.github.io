description: "

Pictured on the right is an Arduino ESP32 wifi board that I programmed to use the Twitter API to send Tweets on
a public Twitter account. The goal was to have a mass alert system to let members of a club know
when the lab was open, but COVID caused the lab to be unavailable and development was discontinued.

<br><br>Also shown is the board from the balloon-launched glider project.

<br><br>Other projects with no pictures include an automatic plant watering setup, small contraptions with servo motors, and assorted small tests for light/hall effect/sound/vibration sensors.
