Pictured on the left is the (now empty) board from the glide project and an Arduino ESP32 wifi board. I set up the ESP32 to use the Twitter API to send Tweets on
a public Twitter account. The goal was to have a mass alert system to let members of a club know
when a lab was open, but COVID caused the lab to be unavailable and development was discontinued.

<br><br>Other projects with no pictures include an automatic plant watering setup, small contraptions with servo motors, and assorted small tests for light/hall effect/sound/vibration sensors.
