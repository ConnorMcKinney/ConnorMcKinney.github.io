Images in reading order:

<br>1. The wing ribs for my glider project. The aerofoil was designed and evaluated in XFLR 5, ported to Fusion 360 as an stl file, and then turned into a solid body that I could
 work with in Fusion. Weight was a concern, so utilizing Fusion's material properties allowed me to estimate how much material I needed to remove to stay within my goal.
 
<br>2. A replacement mouthpiece for a friend's family heirloom candlestick phone. I designed it based on a broken piece given to me, 3D printed it, and did some post-processing to
 clean it up.
  
<br>3. An airsoft pistol to carbine conversion I worked on. The only parts not 3D printed are machine screws, the base airsoft pistol, and an airsoft rifle stock.

<br>4. Another angle of the airsoft conversion.

<br>5. A custom hardshell carrying case for an external harddrive and the buttpad of a prototype custom stock for the airsoft pistol conversion.
